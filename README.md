### Learn how to Convert and Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi
This repository is a written tutorial covering two topics. TensorFlow Lite conversion and running on the Raspberry Pi. This document contains instructions for running on the Raspberry Pi. If you want to convert a Custom TensorFlow 2 Object Detection Model, please refer to the [conversion guide](https://github.com/armaanpriyadarshan/TensorFlow-2-Lite-Object-Detection-on-the-Raspberry-Pi/blob/main/TFLite-Conversion.md). These instructions are likely to change often with time, so if you have questions feel free to raise an issue. ***This guide has last been tested and updated on 11/13/2020.***

**I will soon make a YouTube Tutorial which will be posted [here](), and an extremely import step [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT9t2Bug62RDUfSBcPt0Bzg?sub_confirmation=1)!**
